# Bank-Churn-Prediction
# Motivation
The goals of this project are following:
visualize and identify the factors/features that contributes to the churn of customers
Construct and train a machine learning model to predict the possibility of churns and help custumer service target the factors that may lead to churn and prevent customer churn, reduce loss of profit
# Precedure
+	Visualized and analyzed data related to customer churn by using visualization toolkits: seaborn, matplotlib
+	Preprocessed and transforms categorical data for Machine Learning model training using pandas toolkit and normalization techniques
+	Established Data Pipeline and ML Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc. and Evaluated Models using ROC,AUC 
+	Improved Models Accuracy from 80% to 86% by using Model Selection, Cross Validation and Feature Selection,  L1 Regularization techniques
